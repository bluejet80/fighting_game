# Project Setup

# Create Player and Enemy

## Velocity and Gravity

Velocity is to determine which direction your sprites should be moving when they are inside an animation loop.

Gravity is added to make sure that the players always fall down to the bottom of the game window and stop there.

To get your sprites moving you first need to create an animation loop.
