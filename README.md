# Project Setup

# Create Player and Enemy

## Velocity and Gravity

Velocity is to determine which direction your sprites should be moving when they are inside an animation loop.

Gravity is added to make sure that the players always fall down to the bottom of the game window and stop there.

To get your sprites moving you first need to create an animation loop.

# Move Characters with event listeners

done

# Attacks

Ready to Implement

# Health Bar Interface

# Game Timers and Game Over

# refactor

I would like to put all the code that has to do with key presses and listeners into its own file and maybe have a file just for collision and attack code... etc
